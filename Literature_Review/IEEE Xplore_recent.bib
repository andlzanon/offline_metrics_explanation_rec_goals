  abstract={In recommender systems, leveraging user interaction history as sequential information has recently led to significant performance improvements. However, in many online services, user interactions are often grouped into sessions that inherently share user preferences, requiring a distinct approach from conventional sequence representation techniques. Existing studies have introduced various methods to integrate session information into sequential recommendation models, but most rely on complex network structures, such as hierarchical networks, or introduce substantial additional parameters. In this paper, we revisit the importance of incorporating session information in sequential recommendation models. We propose three methods to enhance recommendation performance by effectively utilizing session information while minimizing additional parameter overhead in deep learning-based sequential recommendation models: session token, session segment embeddings, and temporal self-attention. The proposing methods are designed to be easily integrated into both RNN-based and attention-based models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through extensive experiments on real-world recommendation datasets, achieving up to a 10% performance improvement with only 1% additional parameters.},

  pages={278-290},
  abstract={This paper explores explaining session-based recommendation (SR) by path reasoning. Current SR models emphasize accuracy but lack explainability, while traditional path reasoning prioritizes knowledge graph exploration, ignoring sequential patterns present in the session history. Therefore, we propose a generalized hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for SR, which improves the explainability of existing SR models via Path Reasoning, namely PR4SR. Considering the different importance of items to the session, we design the session-level agent to select the items in the session as the starting nodes for path reasoning and the path-level agent to perform path reasoning. In particular, we design a multi-target reward mechanism to adapt to the skip behaviors of sequential patterns in SR and introduce path midpoint reward to enhance the exploration efficiency and accuracy in knowledge graphs. To improve the knowledge graph’s completeness and diversify the paths of explanation, we incorporate extracted feature information from images into the knowledge graph. We instantiate PR4SR in five state-of-the-art SR models (i.e., GRU4REC, NARM, GCSAN, SR-GNN, SASRec) and compare it with other explainable SR frameworks to demonstrate the effectiveness of PR4SR for recommendation and explanation tasks through extensive experiments with these approaches on four datasets.},

  pages={3563-3576},
  abstract={In the era of Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent recommendation systems are crucial components for users to locate the items they require. Existing recommendation systems overlook the diversity of user behaviors and rely solely on utilizing a singular form of user-item interaction data. Multibehavior recommendation (MBR) works to solve this problem by utilizing multityped user behaviors to mine the heterogeneous relations between users and items to improve recommendation accuracy. Nevertheless, there are still challenges to be overcome, including capture of differences and commonalities between different types of behaviors, learning of users’ personalized behavioral patterns, consideration of semantic knowledge, and building of users’ trust in algorithms. In light of the aforementioned considerations, we propose a knowledge-enhanced explainable MBR model (KEMB-Rec) with graph contrastive learning, comprising two modules. The first is the user behavior-aware module, which mines user’s behavior pattern using the user behavior hyper meta-graphs and captures the differences and commonalities between different behaviors through graph contrastive learning. The second is the semantic knowledge-aware module, which is based on single behavior interaction graphs to mine the semantic relational knowledge, and makes full use of it to represent users and items. Then, we design contrastive learning task and recommendation task, and the two tasks are optimized jointly. At the same time, effective recommendation explanations are provided by mining paths and semantics between users and items as a way to enhance user trust and satisfaction. The proposed KEMB-Rec is evaluated in real-world data sets, with results indicating that KEMB-Rec outperforms various baselines.},

  abstract={The rapid development of learning-based approaches in real life made Link Prediction a key network analysis tool. It has applications in social, biological, information, recommendation, and criminal networks. Many network applications require data security and privacy. Standard LP methods often lack scalability, privacy preservation, and interpretability. To overcome the constraints of standard LP approaches, this study offers Explainable Federated Learning-Based Link Prediction (X-FedLP) models, which integrate FL with XAI in LP. The revolutionary FL models FedNN, FedGNN, FedMF, and FedCF make up X-FedLP. These models are tailor-made for LP and deliver human-friendly results. X-FedLP models were tested using 5 real-world datasets, 3 evaluation criteria, and 8 performance assessment indicators. Prediction, performance, and interpretability are used to evaluate X-FedLP models. Tests show that FedMF and FedCF outperform FedNN and FedGNN.},

  abstract={This paper introduces an explainable Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based recommender system that integrates user-item interactions and user reviews to enhance recommendation accuracy and interpretability. The proposed method leverages Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) as a language model to encode user reviews into vector representations, capturing temporal dynamics and contextual information. Additionally, it extracts opinion-aspect pairs from reviews, enabling the system to understand specific product features and user sentiments. Bipartite graphs are constructed to represent interactions between users/items and opinion aspects, facilitating the integration of user reviews into the GNN framework. A contrastive learning approach is employed to combine these graphs with TCN-generated review embeddings, enhancing the system's ability to capture complex relationships. Finally, a recommendation strategy is proposed which considers relevant opinion-aspects as explanations for recommendations. The experiments conducted on several benchmarks reveal that our method outperforms its competitors.},
