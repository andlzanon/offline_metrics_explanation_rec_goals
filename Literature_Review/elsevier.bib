abstract = {In recent years, explainable recommendation has been a topic of active study. This is because the branch of the machine learning field related to methodologies is enabling human understanding of the reasons for the outputs of recommender systems. The realization of explainable recommendation is widely expected to increase both user satisfaction and the demand for explainable recommendation systems. Explainable recommendation utilizes a wealth of side information (such as sellers, brands, user ages and genders, and bookmark information, among others) to expound the decision-making reasoning applied by recommendation models. In explainable recommendation, although learning side information containing numerous variables leads to rich interpretability, learning too many variables presents a challenge because decreases the amount of learning that a given computational resource can perform, and the accuracy of the recommendation model may be degraded. However, numerous and diverse variables are included in the side information stored by the actual companies operating massive real-world services. Hence, to realize practical applications of this valuable information, it is necessary to resolve problems such as computational cost. In this study, we propose a new framework for explainable recommendation based on an improved knowledge graph attention network model, which utilizes the side information of items and realizes high recommendation accuracy. The proposed framework enables direct interpretation by visualizing the reasons for the recommendations provided. Experimental results show that the proposed framework reduced computational time requirements by approximately 80%, while maintaining recommendation accuracy by enabling the model to learn the probabilistically given edges included in the graph structure. Moreover, the results show that the proposed framework exhibited richer interpretability than the conventional model. Finally, a multifaceted analysis suggests that the proposed framework is not only effective as an explainable recommendation model but also provides a powerful tool for planning various marketing strategies.}

abstract = {Post-hoc explanation aims at defining a simple local surrogate model to shed light on a prediction produced by a complex, generally black-box, model. In the general context of classification, it has been shown that local surrogates may not always be able to capture a local explanation, i.e. for a specific instance prediction, but rather depict more of a general behavior of the black-box. This problem is even more complex in a recommendation scenario where classes and decision boundaries are not explicitly defined and where data are very sparse by nature. We show in this paper that it is possible to tackle these problems with an efficient sampling around the recommendation instance to explain, to finally learn a proper local surrogate model. To this aim, this paper introduces several new approaches to capture efficiently local explanation models in the context of recommendation, all defined around a locality sample. Noticeably, and novel to this work, we show that it is possible to achieve a simple, yet better quality explanation model by not directly considering ratings, but rather implicit preferences as expressed by comparisons of pairs of ratings. We introduce to this extent a novel explainable model based on a pairwise loss RankNet architecture. Extensive experiments show that our methods can be better than state-of-the-art methods depending on the locality of the black-box model, and are much more efficient to retrieve meaningful explainable features locally.}

abstract = {Existing practical recommendation scenarios involve multiple micro-behaviour user–item interactions, such as clicks, page views, add-to-favourites, and purchases, which provide fine-grained and a better in-depth understanding of the user’s preference. Furthermore, some recommendation methods have incorporated item knowledge into the micro-behaviour of user–item interaction. Although some have proved effective, two insights are often neglected. First, they fail to combine micro-behaviour with the relation of the knowledge graph (KG), and the semantic relationship between micro-behaviour and relation is not captured. Second, they do not provide explicit reasoning for micro-behaviour from user–item interaction data. These insights motivated us to propose a novel model of Micro-behaviour with Reinforcement Knowledge-aware Reasoning for Explainable Recommendation (MBKR), which incorporates micro-behaviour and the KG into reinforcement learning for explainable recommendation. Specifically, the model learns the behaviour by user–item propagation and the relation from the KG and combines the two to calculate the behavioural strength to mine user’s interests. In addition, we designed a Shawo-relational path that combines recommendation and interpretability by providing rational paths; these paths capture the semantics of behaviours and relations. Finally, we extensively evaluated our method on several large-scale benchmark datasets, and the results indicate that the proposed method is more effective in providing recommendations than state-of-the-art methods.}

This paper introduces a multistage model that leverages multimodal data embedding and deep transfer learning to accurately capture user preferences and item characteristics, resulting in highly tailored recommendations. A key innovation in this model is the incorporation of an image dataset in the second phase, which addresses cold-start problems for new items by providing additional visual context. Our approach excels in overcoming challenges related to data sparsity and cold-start issues, thereby providing users with realistic and relevant product recommendations. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conducted extensive evaluations using three diverse datasets: data from Brazilian e-commerce platforms, the MovieLens 1M dataset, and the Amazon Product Review dataset. These evaluations involved comprehensive comparisons with standard RS methods to assess performance improvements. The results indicate that our proposed model significantly outperforms traditional RS techniques in terms of accuracy and reliability. Our model provides more accurate and meaningful recommendations by effectively addressing issues such as cold-start and data scarcity. Specifically, the model achieved Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) scores of 0.5883 and 0.4012, respectively, which demonstrate its superior performance metrics across all datasets tested.}

abstract = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) can provide rich, structured information for recommendation systems as well as increase accuracy and perform explicit reasoning. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has also sparked great interest in personalized recommendations. The combination of the two holds promise in carrying out interpretable causal inference procedures and improving the performance of graph-structured recommendation. However, most KG-based recommendation focus on rich semantic relationships between entities in a heterogeneous knowledge graph, and thus fail to fully make use of the image information corresponding to an entity. In order to address these issues, we proposed a novel Multi-modal Knowledge-aware Reinforcement Learning Network (MKRLN), which couples recommendation and interpretability by providing actual paths in multi-modal KG (MKG). The MKRLN can generate path representation by composing the structural and visual information of entities, and infers the underlying rational of agent-MKG interactions by leveraging the sequential dependencies within a path from the MKG. In addition, as KGs have too many attributes and entities, their combination with RL leads to too many action spaces and states in the reinforcement learning space, which complicates the search of action spaces. Furthermore, in order to solve this problem, we proposed a new hierarchical attention-path, which makes users focus their attention on the items they are interested in. This reduces the relations and entities in the KGs, which in turn reduces the action space and state in RL, shortens the path to the target entity, and improves the accuracy of recommendation. Our model has explicit explanation ability in knowledge and images. Finally, we extensively evaluated our model on several large-scale real-world benchmark datasets, and it yielded favorable results compared with state-of-the-art methods.}

abstract = {Review-based recommendation algorithms can alleviate the data sparsity issue in collaborative filtering by combining user ratings and reviews in model learning. However, most existing methods simplify the feature extraction process from reviews by assuming that different granularities of information (e.g., word, review, and feature) are equally important, which cannot optimally leverage the most important information and thus achieves suboptimal recommendation accuracy. Besides, many existing works directly regard text features as users or items representations, which may not be enough to make precise representations due to the large amount of redundant information in reviews. To tackle the two problems mentioned above, we propose a deep learning-based method named Hierarchical Attention Network Oriented Towards Crowd Intelligence (HANCI). First, HANCI replaces the commonly-used topic models or CNN text processor with an RNN text processor in review feature extraction, which can fully exploit the advantages of the sequential dependencies of reviews by using the whole hidden layers of the bidirectional LSTM as outputs. Second, HANCI weighs the importance of features guided by crowd intelligence to more accurately represent each user on each item, and vice versa. Third, HANCI utilizes a hierarchical attention network based on multi-level review text analysis to extract more precise user preferences and item latent features, so that HANCI can explore the importance of words, the usefulness of reviews and the importance of features to achieve more accurate recommendation. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that HANCI outperforms the state-of-the-art review-based recommendation algorithms in accuracy and meanwhile provides insightful explanations.}

abstract = {Explainable recommendation, which provides explanations about why an item is recommended, has attracted growing attention in both research and industry communities. However, most existing explainable recommendation methods cannot provide multi-model explanations consisting of both textual and visual modalities or adaptive explanations tailored for the user’s dynamic preference, potentially leading to the degradation of customers’ satisfaction, confidence and trust for the recommender system. On the technical side, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has become the most prevalent technique to model dynamic user preferences. Benefit from the natural characteristics of RNN, the hidden state is a combination of long-term dependency and short-term interest to some degrees. But it works like a black-box and the monotonic temporal dependency of RNN is not sufficient to capture the user’s short-term interest. In this paper, to deal with the above issues, we propose a novel Attentive Recurrent Neural Network (Ante-RNN) with textual and visual fusion for the dynamic explainable recommendation. Specifically, our model jointly learns image representations with textual alignment and text representations with topical attention mechanism in a parallel way. Then a novel dynamic contextual attention mechanism is incorporated into Ante-RNN for modelling the complicated correlations among recent items and strengthening the user’s short-term interests. By combining the full latent visual-semantic alignments and a hybrid attention mechanism including topical and contextual attentions, Ante-RNN makes the recommendation process more transparent and explainable. Extensive experimental results on two real world datasets demonstrate the superior performance and explainability of our model.}

abstract = {In today’s rapidly evolving digital media landscape, video recommender systems have become central to enhancing user experiences by delivering personalized content. However, they also raise significant concerns about dataveillance—the continuous monitoring of user behavior. This study examines the complex relationship between dataveillance awareness, privacy concerns, perceived value of information disclosure, protective intentions, and self-censorship in video recommender systems. Using structural equation modeling based on data from an online scenario-based experiment (N = 385), our findings reveal that heightened dataveillance awareness significantly increases privacy concerns and diminishes the perceived value of sharing information. These privacy concerns drive users toward protective behaviors, such as self-censorship. Notably, the study reveals a selective disclosure paradox: where users are more likely to engage in self-censorship when they perceive their shared information as valuable, but when they become more aware of being monitored (dataveillance), they start to see their information as less valuable, which makes them less likely to self-censor. Grounded in privacy calculus and protection motivation theories, this research underscores the chilling effect of dataveillance and presents a comprehensive model that explains how perceived privacy risks shape user engagement. By shedding light on unconscious behaviors that may hinder recommender systems’ ability to optimize their algorithms, the findings offer both theoretical insights into digital user behavior and practical recommendations for designing systems that balance personalization with subtle management of perceived disclosure value, ultimately reducing self-censorship.}

To overcome the limitations of ERSs with the offline setting, we propose a novel online setting for ERSs and devise an effective model called O3ERS in this online setting, which can perform online learning with good scalability and rigorous theoretical guides for better online recommendations and online explanations. O3ERS also addresses two challenging problems in real scenarios, namely, the sparsity and delay of online explanations’ feedback as well as the partialness and insufficiency of online recommendations’ feedback. Specifically, O3ERS not only instantly leverages the knowledge learned from the recommendations’ feedback to adjust the sparse and delayed explanations’ feedback for better explanations but also utilizes a novel exploitation–exploration strategy that incorporates the explanations’ feedback to adjust the partial and insufficient recommendations’ feedback for better recommendations. Our theoretical analysis and empirical studies on one simulated and two real-world datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models in online scenarios remarkably.}

To improve such aspects in collaborative filtering algorithms, this paper introduces a multi-domain item reordering system based on the best explanation for an item, which are the best ranked paths extracted from a Linked Open Data knowledge graph connecting recommended and interacted items. To order paths, the algorithm assigns a value to the node attributes connecting two items by calculating the popularity of the property between interacted items that are rare in the full set of items. Results from two datasets of the movie and music domains comparing the proposed reordering system with six baselines of different collaborative filtering families showed that our easy-to-explain approach improved diversity and/or accuracy metrics.}

Among the existing approaches for generating personalized explanations, using existing visual content created by users is a promising option to maximize transparency and user trust. State-of-the-art models that follow this approach, despite leveraging highly optimized architectures, employ surrogate learning tasks that do not efficiently model the objective of ranking images as explanations for a given recommendation; this leads to a suboptimal training process with high computational costs that may not be reduced without affecting model performance.

Research related to natural language text generation has promoted the progress of explainable text generation technology for recommendation systems. This paper proposes an explainable recommendation algorithm based on content summarization and linear attention mechanism. The model uses the keyword extraction algorithm to extract key information from user comment text as an important feature of subsequent text generation tasks, and further introduces linear Transformer to improve the training speed of the model and enhance its scalability. In addition, the model also uses the Vivaldi synthetic coordinate algorithm to deeply mine user and item features and uses the Kolmogorov–Arnold neural network model to reduce the error of predicted ratings. Compared with existing leading algorithms, the algorithm in this paper has achieved significant improvements in text generation and recommendation rating prediction. This paper reveals that applying the linear attention mechanism to the explainable recommendation algorithm can greatly reduce the training cost and improve scalability, and the fusion of synthetic coordinates and attention can further mine the hidden information of the recommendation system, effectively improving the performance of the recommendation algorithm.}

To associate explanations with users and items, graph neural networks (GNN) are usually employed to learn node representations on the heterogeneous user–item–explanation interaction graph. However, modeling heterogeneous graph convolution poses limitations in both message passing styles and computational efficiency, resulting in sub-optimal recommendation performance. To address the limitations, we propose an Explanation-aware Graph Convolution Network (ExpGCN). In particular, the heterogeneous interaction graph is divided to subgraphs regard to the edge types in ExpGCN. By aggregating information from distinct subgraphs, ExpGCN is capable of generating node representations for explanation ranking task and item recommendation task respectively. Task-oriented graph convolution can not only reduce the complexity of heterogeneous node aggregation, but also alleviate the performance degeneration caused by the conflicts between task learning objectives, which has been neglected in current studies. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that ExpGCN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with high efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of ExpGCN in explainable recommendations.}

Although these methods are effective, they lack explainability for recommendations and do not mine side information. In this paper, we propose the use of knowledge graphs which includes additional information about users and items in addition to the use of a user/item interaction matrix. The vital element of our model is neighbourhood aggregation for collaborative filtering. Every user and item are associated with an ID embedding, which is circulated on the interaction graph for users, items, and their attributes. We obtain the final embeddings by combining the embeddings learned at various hidden layers with a biased sum. Our model is easier to train and achieves better performance compared to graph neural network-based collaborative filtering (GCF) and other state-of-the-art recommender methods. We provide evidence for our argument by analytically comparing the knowledge graph convolution network (KGCN) with GCF and eight other state-of-the-art methods, using similar experimental settings and the same datasets.}

However, traditional KG-based recommender systems encounter the challenge of gradient explosion as the network depth increases. Additionally, the abundance of unreliable paths in a KG has a detrimental impact on feature representation learning. In this article, we propose a KG-enhanced recommender system based on residual network and attention mechanism, which can capture high-order connectivity and long-range dependencies of the KG. Specifically, a resource allocation approach is employed to calculate the resource amount, which is subsequently utilized to evaluate the path reliability of the KG. After completing path extraction, we employ an attention mechanism to capture semantic correlations and structural information. To leverage the KG for enhancing recommender systems, we design a deep residual network with shortcut connections, effectively amalgamating advanced and abstract features using deep neural networks. The introduction of shortcut connections not only facilitates the fitting of residual mappings but also mitigates potential issues such as gradient explosion and convergence difficulties due to excessive network depth. Extensive experiments conducted on three standard datasets over baseline methods have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed recommender system.}

abstract = {Knowledge graph based explainable recommendation system is a kind of personalized recommendation which uses side information to solve the reason why recommending an item. Previous study has not fully explored the connection between users and items in knowledge graph, especially the problem of overall semantic representation, and can not capture the high level semantic representation of the path, it is difficult for existing path-based methods to clarify the overall semantics of paths. Especially when the path contains similar entities but different relationship. In this paper, we propose a model named Meta-Path-based Explainable Recommendation System (MPERS) to represent the paths in the knowledge graph through the semantic information of entities and relationships, and distinguish the different contributions that different paths make to conduct users’ preference. The experimental study demonstrates the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art ones}

abstract = {Explainable Recommendation aims at not only providing the recommended items to users, but also enabling users to be aware of why these items are recommended. To better understand the recommended results, textual reviews have been playing an increasingly important role in the recommender systems. However, how to learn the latent representation of user preferences and item features, and how to model the interactions between them effectively via specific aspects in the reviews are two crucial problems in the explainable recommendation. To this end, we propose a novel Triple-Attentional Explainable Recommendation with Temporal Convolutional Network, named TAERT, which is to jointly generate recommendation results and explanations. Specifically, we first explore a feature learning method based on Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to derive word-aware and review-aware vector representations. Then, we introduce three levels of attention networks to model word contribution, review usefulness and importance of latent factors, respectively. Finally, the predicted rating is inferred by the factor-level attention based prediction layer. Furthermore, the attention mechanism is also conducive to identifying the representative item reviews and highlighting the informative words to generate explanations. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, comprehensive experiments on six real-world datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness on both recommendation and explanation.}

abstract = {Recommender systems are popularly used to deal with an information overload issue. Existing systems mainly focus on user–item interactions and semantic information derived from metadata of users and items to improve recommendation accuracy. Item images provide useful information to infer users’ individual preferences, especially for those domains where visual factors are influential such as fashion items. However, this type of information has been ignored by most previous work. To bridge this gap and meet the requirements of performance from the aspects of Accuracy, Scalability, and Explainability evaluation metrics, this paper proposes a scalable and explainable visually-aware recommender system framework called SEV-RS. This framework contains a visually-augmented heterogeneous information network, a scalable meta-path feature extraction method for multi-hop relations, and a shallow explainable meta-path based Collaborative Filtering recommendation approach. We compared SEV-RS with the state-of-the-art models such as the deep learning model using Graph Attention Network on two real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset. The results show that SEV-RS produced more accurate and more explainable recommendations. Also, SEV-RS has substantially less computational time than the compared deep learning models.}

abstract = {Explainable recommendations can not only recommend items to users but also provide corresponding explanations, which is crucial for enhancing the transparency, credibility, and security of the system. Reviews, as an important information source for explainable recommendations, have received considerable attention. However, existing review-based explainable recommendations focus primarily on exploring user preferences and item features, as well as generating explanations from reviews, overlooking the limitations imposed by review sparsity on model performance. To address this issue, we propose an Implicit Review-enhanced Graph Neural Network (IReGNN) for explainable recommendations. Specifically, we construct a review network and a rating network, respectively. For the review network, we adopt an unsupervised approach to mine different topics of users and items, thereby enhancing node attribute representations. On the other hand, for the rating network, we extract implicit relationships between individuals and generate virtual reviews under the constraint of topics, which can effectively alleviate the data sparsity issue. Finally, we leverage a spatial graph neural network to learn node representations, generating accurate recommendations and high-quality explanations. Through a series of experiments on three publicly available datasets, results demonstrate that IReGNN outperforms eight baseline models in terms of rating prediction and explanation quality. Moreover, our model also has certain advantages in sparse data scenarios. The model and datasets are released at: https://github.com/SamuelZack/IReGNN.git.}

This research presents a novel approach to recommendation systems by integrating both user and item content auxiliary information. By harnessing the rich contextual data associated with users and items, our hybrid approach ConvSeq-MF endeavors to provide more personalized and accurate recommendations. As the name indicates, it is based on a matrix factorization approach driven by joint venture of semantic and contextual information of both user’s and item’s.
